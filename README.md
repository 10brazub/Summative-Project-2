# Summative Project 2

### This project was worked on by Brandon Zubia and Robert Velasquez

In this project, you will work together with a team to build a REST API to manage inventory for a bookstore. You will also provide support for querying with GraphQL. In addition, you will produce a 1â€“3 minute video summary of the project. The requirements and features are detailed below.

## User Stories

Your service must implement the following user stories:

- As an API user, I would like to create, read, update, and delete authors.
- As an API user, I would like to create, read, update, and delete publishers.
- As an API user, I would like to create, read, update, and delete books.
- As an API user, I would like to find all books by a given author.

## Requirements

### General Setup and Format

- Your project must be created in an IntelliJ project called Summative-2-Lastname-Firstname.
- Initialize the project using start.spring.io using project options as demonstrated previously in class:
    - Project: Maven
    - Language: Java
    - Spring Boot: 2.7.7-SNAPSHOT
    - Project Metadata:
        - Group: com.company
        - Artifact: bookstore
        - Note: Setting the Artifact value will automatically update the values for Name and Package Name.
    - Packaging: Jar
    - Java: 8
    - Dependencies: Spring Web, Spring Data JPA, and Spring for GraphQL.
- Your project must have a series of tests using MockMvc.
- Your project must use the existing book_store database.
- Your REST API must accept and return data in JSON format where appropriate.
- Your REST API must be documented using Swagger.
    - Save the .yaml file in the root of the project directory.

### Bookstore REST API

- Your project must be based on the existing book_store database. The script to create the book_store database is provided.
- The Bookstore web service manages inventory for a bookstore. You must implement and document REST APIs to allow callers to create, read, read all, update, and delete Books, Authors, and Publishers in the system. The system must also allow callers to find Books by Author.

### Bookstore GraphQL

- Your project must support GraphQL queries to retrieve the following information:
    - Get a publisher by id.
        - Including books for the publisher and authors for the books.
    - Get an author by id.
        - Including books by the author.
    - Get a book by id.
        - Including the author and publisher of the book.

### Video Summary

- Create a 1 to 3 minute video summary of your project that meets the following requirements:
    - Video should be created in MP4 format.
    - Video should include screen-capture recordings to highlight the sections of the project that are important in meeting the project requirements.

### Submission

- Copy your folder: When you have completed your project, copy your completed Summative-2-Lastname-Firstname folder into your personal GitHub repository, commit, and push to GitHub.
- Confirm: Navigate to your GitHub repository and confirm that the Summative-2-Lastname-Firstname folder exists and contains your code.
- Cite Sources: It is your responsibility to include a note in the README section of your repo specifying code source and its location within your repo. This applies if you have worked with a peer on an assignment, used code which you did not author or create sourced from a forum such as Stack Overflow, or you received code outside curriculum content from support staff such as an Instructor, TA, Tutor, or Learning Assistant.  This will provide visibility to grading staff of your circumstances in order to avoid flagging your work as plagiarized.
